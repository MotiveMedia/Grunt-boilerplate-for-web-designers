# Grunt-Boilerplate-for-web-designers

A super-basic grunt-boilerplate for web-designers. The main idea is to deliver a designer-friendly boilerplate out of the box. Some of it's current features:

- Compile .sass and .scss files
- Compass and Burbon support
- JsLinter
- CSS, JS and HTML minification
- Image optimizasion

## Installation and Dependencies

You need to install grunt (http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) in order to run the tasks. When you are ready you also need to install the below ruby gem in order to optimise the images (find out how to install gems here(http://guides.rubygems.org/rubygems-basics/)). Find out how to install Ruby here(https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

- `gem install image_optim`

Then simply run the below npm command and you're done!

- `npm install`

 Your "development" environment is the "app" folder (you do most of your work there).


## TODO:

- Optimize some tasks
- fix the "Port 35729 is already in use by another process"
- Add .sass support (and keep the folder structure)
